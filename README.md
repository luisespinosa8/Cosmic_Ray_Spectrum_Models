# Cosmic Ray Spectrum Models
### Here I plan to test some phenomenological models of cosmic ray spectrum, re-perfmorm the fitting with observational data to corroborate their results and elaborate my own model for the spectrum of cosmic rays at the *knee*.
## Models considered:
### [1] The model for the hardening and softening of cosmic ray protons in (Lipari & Vernetto, 2019).
#### * *Used data from the Cosmic-Ray Data Base (CRDB) by D. Maurin, F. Melot, and H. Dembinski.*
